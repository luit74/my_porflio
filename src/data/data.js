    description:"I built a To-Do List application using vanilla JavaScript that allows users to add, check, and delete tasks dynamically. Tasks are created using DOM manipulation with document.createElement() and displayed in a list container with a delete button (Ã—) for easy removal. A checked class toggle marks completed tasks, and all data is stored in localStorage using saveData() and retrieved with showTask(), ensuring tasks persist after page reloads. This project strengthened my understanding of event handling, dynamic UI updates, and browser storage management. ",
